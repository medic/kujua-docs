# Contributing

At Medic Mobile we welcome and appreciate community contributions.

## Ways to contribute

### Communication

If you have an idea or a question we'd love to hear from you! The easiest way to get in touch is by raising issues in the [medic-docs Github repo](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/issues). You can also reach out on our community Slack channel. You can request access via [this _Community Health Toolkit_ page](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/slack).

### Submitting changes

1. Before starting on changes we recommend you raise an issue or message us on [Slack](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/slack).
2. When submiting a PR with a full description of the issue you're solving and if possible including a link to the GitHub issue.
3. Your PR will be reviewed by a Medic team member. Most PRs have at least one change requested before they're merged so don't be offended if your change doesn't get accepted on the first try!
