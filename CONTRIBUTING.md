# Contributing

The Community Health Toolkit is powered by people like you. Your contributions help us create open source technology for a new model of healthcare that reaches everyone.

## Communication
We recommend you raise an issue on Github or start a conversation on our [Community Forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/) about the change you want to make before you start on code. Our Community Forum is especially helpful if you are a new contributor or find yourself unsure how to move forward with an issue.

## Ways to contribute

### Improving our documentation
**Note:** medic-docs does not involve release management and acceptance testing. Help us maintain the quality of our documentation by submitting a pull request (PR) with any suggested changes. 

Is our documentation up to date? Have we covered everything we should? Could our wording be improved? Read our [Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/docs-style-guide.md) then open a pull request with your suggested changes or additions.

### Submitting code
**Note:** We recommend you raise an issue on Github or start a conversation on our Community Forum about the change you want to make before you start on code.

1. Read our [Development Workflow](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/workflow.md) to understand how we work, and review our [Code Style Guide](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/style-guide.md) before you begin.
2. Before you submit a pull request, please make sure your contribution passes all tests. Test failures need to be addressed before we can merge your contribution.
3. Provide detail about the issue you are solving in the pull request description. Note: If your pull request addresses a specific issue, please reference it using medic/<repo>#<issue number>
4. Our CI will automatically schedule a build; monitor the build to ensure it passes.
5. Your PR will be reviewed by one of the repository's maintainers. Most PRs have at least one change requested before they're merged so don't be offended if your change doesn't get accepted on the first try!
