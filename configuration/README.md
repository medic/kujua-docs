# Overview
Documentation within this directory covers developing and configuring community health applications using the Medic Mobile framework. Setting up the core framework itself is covered in the [medic repo](https://github.com/medic/medic#easy-deployment). 

# Getting Started
An introduction and reference for developing community health applications is provided in [Developing Community Health Applications](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/developing-community-health-applications.md), which also covers building forms, tasks, targets, and contact profiles.

# SMS Workflows
Workflows that use SMS are defined in the file `app_settings.json`. The following guides should help with setting that up.
- [Defining SMS Forms](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/forms.md#json-forms)
- [Configuring SMS responses](app-settings.md)
- [SMS Form Validations](app-settings-validations.md)
- [Variables in outgoing SMS](variables-in-messages.md)
