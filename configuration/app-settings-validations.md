# App Settings Validations
Validation rules are code fragments used to determine if some input is valid. For example, to say a field is only valid if the value has at least five characters, you would use the lenMin(5). They are used in `registrations[].validations.list[].rule` and `patient_reports[].validations.list[].rule` to determine if an incoming report is accepted. A report is accepted as valid only if all rules return `true`. If any validation rule returns `false` then the report is marked as invalid, and a message is automatically sent to the submitter. The content for the message is set in the `translation_key` associated to each rule. If a report fails multiple validations then each message will be sent. These can be combined into a single SMS by specifying `"*.validations.join_responses" : true`.

## Operators
The available operators are:

| Operator | Description |
|----|----|
| && |and |
| \|\| |or |
| ! |not |
| a ? b : c | ternary, ie: if 'a' is true, then check 'b', otherwise check 'c' |
| () | nested blocks, eg: 'a && (b || c)' |

## Rules
Validation settings may consist of Pupil.js rules and rules specific to Medic Mobile.
These two types of rules cannot be combined as part of the same rule.

Not OK:
`rule: "regex(\d{5}) && unique('patient_id')"`

OK:
`rule: "regex(\d{5}) && max(11111)"`
     
If for example you want to validate that patient_id is 5 numbers and it
is unique (or some other custom validation) you need to define two
validation configs/separate rules in your settings. Example validation
settings:

```
[
	{
		property: "patient_id",
		rule: "regex(\d{5})",
		message: [{
		    content: "Patient ID must be 5 numbers.",
		    locale: "en"
	}]
	},
	{
		property: "patient_id",
		rule: "unique('patient_id')",
		message: [{
		    content: "Patient ID must be unique.",
		    locale: "en"
		}]
	}
]
```

`validate()` modifies the property value of the second item to
`patient_id_unique` so that pupil.validate() still returns a valid
result.  Then we process the result once more to extract the custom
validation results and error messages.

### Pupil.js validation functions

Available validation functions are available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/pupil#validation-functions

The following functions are available by default:

| Function | Description |
|----|----|
| `equals` |  Comparison |
| `iEquals` |  Case insensitive comparison |
| `sEquals` |  Type sensitive equals |
| `siEquals` |  Type sensitive case insensitive equals |
| `lenMin` |  Minimum length |
| `lenMax` |  Maximum length |
| `lenEquals` |  Exact length |
| `min` |  Minimum value |
| `max` |  Maximum value |
| `between` |  Minimum and maximum value |
| `in` |  One of the provided values |
| `required` |  Must have a value |
| `optional` |  Always valid |
| `numeric` |  Numbers only |
| `integer` |  Integer numbers only |
| `alpha` |  Letters only |
| `alphaNumeric` |  Numbers and letters only |
| `email` |  Email address format |
| `regex` |  A custom regular expression |
| `equalsTo` | Compare to another field by its key |

#### Sample usage

For case-insensitive comparison `iEquals` function in Pupil, 
And you can use `||` for logical OR : https://www.npmjs.com/package/pupil#rule-strings

So you can do this : 
`rule: 'iEquals("mary") || iEquals("john")'`
matches "mary", "Mary", "john", "John", "JOhN", etc. Not "maryjohn"

### Medic Mobile validation functions
| Function | Description |
|----|----|
| `unique(*fields)` | Returns `true` if no existing valid report has the same value for all of the listed fields. Fields are compared to those at the top level and within `fields` for every report doc. To include the form type use `'form'` as one of the fields. Eg `uniqueWithin('form', 'patient_id', '1 week')` checks that the same report wasn't submitted for this patient in the past week. |
| `uniqueWithin(*fields, time_period)` | Same as `unique` but the last argument is the time period in which to search. Eg `uniqueWithin('form', 'patient_id')` checks that this report was never submitted for this patient. |
| `exists(form_id, field)` | Returns `true` if a report matches the `form_id` and value for `field`. This is useful to check that a patient was registered for a service before reporting about it. Eg `exists('REG', 'patient_id')` checks that a `REG` form was already submitted for a patient. As of 2.12 most uses of this function are obsolete because checking for a valid `patient_id` is done automatically by the `accept_patient_report` transition using `registration_not_found` in the `messages.event_type`. |
| `isISOWeek(weekFieldName[, yearFieldName])` | Returns `true` if the current report has a week value that is less or equal to the number of ISO weeks of the current year or the year value of the same report. The first parameter is the field name for the week and the second parameter is the field name for the year: `isISOWeek('week', 'year')`. If the second parameter is not specified, then the current year is used: `isISOWeek('week')`. |
