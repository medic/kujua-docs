# Tasks

Tasks are used in the app to help CHWs plan their activities by reminding them about forms they need to complete on behalf of their patients. They are essentially the Medic app's version of SMS reminders - instead of receiving an SMS reminder, the app generates a task for the CHW to complete. When a CHW clicks on a tasks from the Tasks tab or from a contact profile, they will be taken to the designated form that they need to fill in order to complete the task.

Tasks can be viewed in a few places in the Medic app. Tasks for a particular patient can be viewed on the patient's profile, tasks for a family/household as well as the family members can be viewed on the family/household profile, and all tasks for all patients and families can be viewed on the tasks tab. Tasks are listed in order of due date. Tasks that are past due will appear at the top of the list and tasks due in the future will appear at the end of the list. If a task is high priority (more on this in the next two sections) it will come first within the subset of tasks that are due on its due date. So if you have three tasks due on Thursday and one of them is high priority, the high priority task will be the first in the list of tasks due on Thursday.

Tasks can be configured for any user that has offline access (user type is "restricted to their place"). When configuring tasks, you have access to all the contacts (people and places) that your logged in user can view, along with all the reports about them. Tasks can also pull in fields from the reports that trigger them and pass these fields in as inputs to the form that opens when you click on the task. So, for example, if you register a pregnancy and include the LMP, this generates follow-up tasks for ANC visits. When you click on an ANC visit task, it will open the ANC visit form and this form could "know" the LMP of the woman. More on how to configure this later in this document.

## Types of Tasks

The main two types of tasks we have are normal tasks and high priority tasks.

### Normal Task

A normal task has an icon, a title and a due date.

![Normal task](../img/normal_task.png)

### High Priority Task

A high priority task has an icon, a title, and a due date, just like a normal task. In addition, it has the high risk icon and a descriptive message on the second line.

### Task Summary Screen

When a user clicks on a task in the task list, the app can either take them to the task summary screen...

![Task summary screen](../img/task_summary_screen.png)

...or directly to the action (form) they need to complete.

## Using Tasks

As you'll see in the `rules.nools.js` files for existing projects, in order to make tasks work, you have to first create the task and then emit the task. There are functions for both of these steps already written. You can also create custom task creation functions if it is useful.

### Creating a Task

```javascript
var createTask = function(contact, schedule, report) {
  return new Task({
    _id: contact.contact._id + '-' + schedule.id,
    deleted: (contact.contact ? contact.contact.deleted : false) || (report ? report.deleted : false),
    doc: contact,
    contact: contact.contact,
    icon: schedule.icon,
    priority: schedule.description ? 'high' : null,
    priorityLabel: schedule.description ? schedule.description : '',
    date: null,
    title: schedule.title,
    fields: [],
    resolved: false,
    actions: []
  });
};
```

### Emitting a Task

```javascript
var emitTask = function(task, scheduleEvent) {
  if (Utils.isTimely(task.date, scheduleEvent)) {
    emit('task', task);
  }
};
```

## Task Properties

When creating a task, you are required to pass in a contact, a schedule and a report (see above function). Tasks have many properties:

* `_id`: By default, the `_id` is set to [contact ID]-[schedule ID]. [contact ID] is the `_id` of the contact that you passed in. [schedule ID] is the `id` of the particular task that you indicated in your `tasks.json` file.
* `deleted`: Set based on whether the report that generated the task is deleted.
* `doc`: Set to the contact you passed in and includes their contact info and an array of the reports about that contact
* `contact`: Set to the contact you passed in. Has contact information only.
* `icon`: Set to the `icon` specified for the task in `tasks.json`.
* `priority`: Set to high priority if there is a description for the task in `tasks.json`. High priority means that the task has the high risk icon on the right hand side.
* `priorityLabel`: Set to the `description` listed in `tasks.json` for the task if there is a description. Use a translation key for internationalisation support.
* `date`: This is the due date of the task. It is left null during task creation and set later.
* `title`: Set to the `title` that you indicated in your `tasks.json` file. The title is the text that appears in the UI on the task. Use a translation key for internationalisation support.
* `fields`: Fields are pieces of data that display on the task summary screen. List a label and value for each field you want to display on the summary screen.
* `resolved`: This tracks whether or not the task has been completed. It is set to false initially and then updated to a condition later.
* `actions`: This is an array of the actions (forms) that a user can access after clicking on a task. If you put multiple forms here, then the user will see a task summary screen where they can select which action they would like to complete.

Within your array of `actions` there are some additional properties that you can define:

* `actions[n].type`: Type of action, usually `'report'`.
* `actions[n].form`: The form that should open when you click on the action.
* `actions[n].label`: The label that should appear on the button to start this action on the task summary page ('Click here to begin the follow up' in our example summary screen above).
* `actions[n].content`: Contains fields that you want to pass into the form that will open when you click on the task or action.

## Tips & Tricks

1. `actions[n].content` is where you can pass form fields from the report that triggered the action to the form that will open when you click on a task. Be sure you include `content.source: 'task'`, `content.source_id: r._id` and `content.contact: c.contact`. The `source` and `source_id` are used in Analytics to relate a task to the action that triggered it.
1. There are some use cases where information collected during an action within a task schedule may mean that the task schedule must change. For example, if you register a child for malnutrition follow-ups, you collect the height and weight during registration and tasks for follow-ups are created based on the registration. At the next visit (first follow-up), you collect the height and weight again and you want to update these so that future tasks reference this new height and weight. You can either clear and regenerate the schedule after each follow-up visit is done, or you can create only one follow-up at a time so that height and weight are always referencing the most recent visit.

## Configuring Tasks

Tasks are configured in two places: `rules.nools.js` and `tasks.json`. `rules.nools.js` is where you define which form submissions trigger tasks and set the rules for creation and emission of tasks, including which types of users will see which tasks. This is also where you can pull information from the form that triggers the task schedule and pass it to the form that the user needs to fill to complete the tasks. More information on this is below.

`tasks.json` is where you define all of the different tasks in each of your task schedules. You set the due date and task window, the icon and the task title.

### `tasks.json`

Each task needs a due date, window, icon and title to be defined so that the app knows how to render it. The diagram below explains where each of the properties will appear. You will need to include the properties listed after the diagram for each of your task schedules.

![Task description](../img/task_with_description.png)

* `name`: This is the name of the task schedule. It's used when retrieving a particular task schedule from `tasks.json` for use in `rules.nools.js`.
* `events`: These are the individual tasks in the schedule. You may have one or more tasks in your schedule.

For each event, you need to include the following:

* `events[n].id`: This is an `id` you define for each of your tasks.
* `events[n].days`: Due date for the task. It is the number of days after the schedule start date that a task is due.
* `events[n].start`: The number of days before the task due date that the task should appear in the task list.
* `events[n].end`: The number of days after the task due date that the task should continue to appear in the task list.
* `events[n].icon`: You can use any icon that you like, but make sure the icon has been uploaded to your instance and the name matches.
* `events[n].title`: The name of your task that will appear to the user. This field supports locales, so you can include translations if you have users viewing the app in different languages on the same instance.
* `events[n].description`: This is optional. It is a second line of text that can appear at the right side of the task on the tasks list.

#### Example Task Definition - Normal Task

This example shows one task in the schedule. For schedules with multiple tasks, add an event for each task.

```
{
  "name": "assessment-treatment",
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "treatment-followup-1",
      "days": 2,
      "start": 2,
      "end": 2,
      "icon": "treatment",
      "title": [
        {
          "content": "{{contact.name}} treatment follow up",
          "locale": "en"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example Task Definition - High Priority Task

This example shows one task in the schedule. For schedules with multiple tasks, add an event for each task.

```
{
  "name": "assessment-referral",
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "referral-followup-1",
      "days": 1,
      "start": 1,
      "end": 3,
      "icon": "clinic",
      "title": [
        {
          "content": "{{contact.name}} referral follow up",
          "locale": "en"
        }
      ],
      "description": [
        {
          "content": "Referral made",
          "locale": "en"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `rules.nools.js`

Each task must also be created and emitted, as discussed above. The creation and emission of tasks happens in `rules.nools.js`. This is also where you will define when a task should be generated and for which types of users. Depending on how many types of tasks you have in your project, you may choose to use a switch statement with a case for each type of report.

#### Nools

The task and target generation uses Nools - more information about how to configure task rules is available in [the Nools repository](https://github.com/noolsjs/nools).

#### Utils

Some utility functions are available to your rule configuration and have been included to make common tasks much easier. To use the function call `Utils.<function-name>(<params>)`, for example `Utils.addDate(report.reported_date, 10)`.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| isTimely(date, event) | Returns true if the given date is after the start date and before the end date of the event. |
| addDate(date, days) | Returns a new Date set to midnight the given number of days after the given date. If no date is given the date defaults to today. |
| getLmpDate(doc) | Attempts to work out the LMP from the given doc. If no LMP is given it defaults to four weeks before the reported_date. |
| getSchedule(name) | Returns the task schedule with the given name from the configuration. |
| getMostRecentTimestamp(reports, form) | Returns the reported_date of the most recent of the reports with form ID matching the given form. |
| getMostRecentReport(reports, form) | Like `getMostRecentTimestamp` but returns the report, not just the reported_date. |
| isFormSubmittedInWindow(reports, form, start, end) | Returns true if any of the given reports are for the given form and were reported after start and before end. |
| isFirstReportNewer(firstReport, secondReport) | Returns true if the firstReport was reported before the secondReport. |
| isDateValid(date) | Returns true if the given date is a validate JavaScript Date. |
| now() | Returns the current Date. |
| MS_IN_DAY | A constant for the number of milliseconds in a day. |

If you can think of any others you'd like to be included raise an issue in [medic/medic](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues).

#### Examples

Below are some examples of tasks - examples are using the switch statement.

##### ICCM Follow-up

In this example, we are generating a follow-up for either a treatment or a referral, depending on the outcome of the ICCM assessment.

```javascript
case 'assessment':
  var followupType = 'treat'; // will be one of: treat, refer

  if (r.fields) {
    // The follow-up schedule is based on the `reported_date`, so store it for use later
    var reportedDate = new Date(r.reported_date);
    // Set schedule name to the one for treatment follow-up
    var scheduleName = 'assessment-treatment';

    // Check to see if the patient was referred
    if (r.fields.referral_follow_up == 'true') {
      // If they were, change the follow-up type and schedule name accordingly
      followupType = 'refer';
      scheduleName = 'assessment-referral';
    }

    // Get the task schedule that you specified in `tasks.json`
    var schedule = Utils.getSchedule(scheduleName);

    if (schedule) {
      schedule.events.forEach(function(s) {
        // Determine the due date by taking the base date (`reported_date` in this case) and adding the number of days specified
        var dueDate = new Date(Utils.addDate(reportedDate, s.days));
        var visit = createTask(c, s, r);
        // Set the due date of the task
        visit.date = dueDate;
        // This task should be cleared if the `assessment_follow_up` form is submitted within the task window
        visit.resolved = Utils.isFormSubmittedInWindow(c.reports, 'assessment_follow_up', Utils.addDate(dueDate, s.start * -1).getTime(), Utils.addDate(dueDate, s.end).getTime() );
        // We only have one available action this time
        visit.actions.push({
          type: 'report',
          form: 'assessment_follow_up',
          content: {
            source: 'task',
            source_id: r._id,
            contact: c.contact,
            // Include the follow-up type as an input to the `assessment_follow_up` form
            t_follow_up_type: followupType,
          }
        });
        emitTask(visit, s);
      });
    }
  }
  break;
```

##### Pregnancy Visits

In this example, we see how we can use the task summary screen and have two available actions from one task.

```javascript
case 'pregnancy':

  if ( !(r.fields && r.fields.lmp_date ) ) { break; }

  // The schedule will be based on the LMP date, so store it
  var lmp = new Date(r.fields.lmp_date);

  // Set the schedule name
  var scheduleName = 'pregnancy-healthy';
  // If the pregnancy is is high-risk, adjust the schedule name
  if ((pregnancy.fields.risk_factors && pregnancy.fields.risk_factors != '') 
    || (pregnancy.fields.danger_signs && pregnancy.fields.danger_signs != '')
    || parseInt(pregnancy.fields.patient_age_at_lmp, 10) < 18
    || parseInt(pregnancy.fields.patient_age_at_lmp, 10) > 35 ){
      scheduleName = 'pregnancy-high-risk';
  }

  // Get the specified task schedule
  var schedule = Utils.getSchedule(scheduleName);
  if (schedule) {
    schedule.events.forEach(function(s) {
      // Determine the due date by taking the base date (`lmp`) and adding the number of days you specified
      var dueDate = new Date(Utils.addDate(lmp, s.days));
      var visit = createTask(c, s, r);
      // Set the task due date
      visit.date = dueDate;
      // Add fields to be displayed on the task summary screen
      visit.fields.push({
        label: [
          {
            content: 'Patient Age',
            locale: 'en'
          }
        ],
        value: [
          {
            content: age,
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        label: [
          {
            content: 'EDD',
            locale: 'en'
          }
        ],
        value: [
          {
            content: edd_date,
          }
        ]
      });
      // This task should be cleared if there is a newer pregnancy, there has been a delivery, or visit done in the task window
      visit.resolved = r.reported_date < newestPregnancyTimestamp || r.reported_date < newestPostnatalTimestamp || Utils.isFormSubmittedInWindow(c.reports, 'pregnancy_visit', Utils.addDate(dueDate, s.start * -1).getTime(), Utils.addDate(dueDate, s.end).getTime());
      // We are adding two possible actions, Pregnancy Visit and Delivery Report
      visit.actions.push({
        type: 'report',
        form: 'pregnancy_visit',
        label: 'Pregnancy Visit',
        content: {
          source: 'task',
          source_id: r._id,
          contact: c.contact,
          // Include the LMP so that we can use it during the pregnancy visit
          t_lmp_date: lmp.toISOString()
        }
      },
      {
        type: 'report',
        form: 'delivery_report',
        label: 'Delivery Report',
        content: {
          source: 'task',
          source_id: r._id,
          contact: c.contact,
          // Include the LMP so that we can use it during the pregnancy visit
          t_lmp_date: lmp.toISOString()
        }
      });
      emitTask(visit, s);
    });
  }
```
