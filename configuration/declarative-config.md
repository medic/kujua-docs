# Overview
Workflows in the Medic app are highly flexible using a combination of XForms, JSON, and JavaScript files. The JavaScript portion allows for full control of tasks, targets, and contact profiles. This portion of the application was time consuming to write, and error prone to maintain over time. For this reason we've created a simpler way to define the application code. Previously iterative code generates all configured elements. Now, with the _declarative_ method, you define each element in the app in a modular way, and then specify when and how it should show. This document is meant to be a guide for developing tasks, targets, and contact profiles in the Medic app in a more declarative fashion.

# Background
Having robust application code is pivotal in having a successful deployment of Medic tools. The Tasks, Targets, and Contact Summary in Medic Mobile applications are driven by JavaScript code. It has historically been a series of nested loops and conditional statements, using functions and calculations to pump out each task, target, and contact profile card to show. This code-heavy method is difficult to write, understand, maintain, and test because imperative code spews out application elements with project-specific logic. Modifying any element requires understanding large portions of the workflow, including the code and context. As the number of Tasks, Targets, or Condition Cards increases, so does the complexity, exponentially. As a result strong development skills were needed to create and manage each application, as well as considerable time to understand the workflows and context. An error in any of this code could make the application non-usable, which does not always get reported to project managers.

In order to build and maintain robust applications quickly we now have isolated each configured element (ie task, targets, contact profile fields and condition cards) and attached to it the logic needed to display them properly. Writing new elements is easier because they are independent from others. Similarly, editing existing elements requires understanding of that individual element only, and changes to one element do not impact others in the application.

All Actions, Tasks, and Contact creation/edit forms are defined as [ODK XForms](https://opendatakit.github.io/xforms-spec/) -- a XML definition of the structure and format for a set of questions. You can find out more about creating these forms in the [forms documentation](forms.md#xforms). When a user completes an Action or Task form the contents are saved in the database with the type `data_record`. These docs are known as _Reports_. Completed Contact forms are saved in the database with their respective type: 'person', 'clinic', 'health_center', and 'district_hospital'. All of these types are collectively referred to here as _Contacts_. 

# Tasks
Tasks guide health workers through their days and weeks. Each generated task prompts a preconfigured workflow, ensuring that the right actions are taken for the people at the right time.

Tasks are available only for users of type "restricted to their place", because this implies that their data is stored and queried locally on their device. When defining tasks, you have access to all the contacts (people and places) that the logged in user can view, along with all the reports about them. Tasks can also pull in fields from the reports that trigger them and pass these fields in as inputs to the form that opens when you click on the task. For example, if you register a pregnancy and include the LMP, this generates follow-up tasks for ANC visits. When you click on an ANC visit task, it will open the ANC visit form and this form could "know" the LMP of the woman. In this section we will discuss how to configure such tasks.

A rules engine is used to generate the tasks using the data available in the client app. The data, comprised of docs for people, places, and the reports about them, are processed by rules engine code to emit tasks like this one:

<!-- TODO: Update annotated screenshots -->
![Task description](img/task_with_description.png)

Previously, the code to generate tasks would iterate through an object with all contacts accompanied by their reports. When the code identified a condition that needs tasks, it generated a series of tasks based on templates in `tasks.json`. The tasks emitted by the rules engine code were then handled by the app. With the new declarative style all tasks are now defined in the `tasks.js` file, which contains a JavaScript array of objects. Each object corresponds to a set of task events that the app automatically shows in the Tasks tab and on contact profiles. These are automatically removed from the app when they are completed. The properties for the object are used to define when the task's events can show, and what they should look like.

Although the file contains JavaScript, its modular and declarative nature makes it much easier to manage. For instance, here is a simple example that generates two `postnatal-visit` tasks for each `delivery` form:

```js
[
  {
    icon: 'mother-child',
    title: [ { locale:'en', content:'Postnatal visit needed' } ],
    appliesTo: 'reports',
    appliesToType: [ 'delivery' ],
    actions: [ { form:'postnatal_visit' } ],
    events: [
      {
        id: 'postnatal-visit-1',
        days:7, start:2, end:2,
      },
      {
        id: 'postnatal-visit-2',
        days:14, start:2, end:2,
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Task properties

More complex tasks can be written using the full set of properties for tasks, as detailed in the following table.

| property | description | required |
|---|---|---|
| `name`| Unique identifier for the task. | no |
| `icon` | The icon to show alongside the task. | no |
| `title` | The title of the task when shown in the app. Structured as a localization label array or a translation. | yes |
| `appliesTo` | `'contacts'`, `'reports'`, or `'scheduled_tasks'`. The items on which the task is applied. | yes |
| `appliesToType` | Array of report or contact types. The types of contacts (eg `['person']`, `['clinic', 'health_center']`) or form codes (eg `['pregnancy']`, `['P', 'pregnancy']`) for which this task should be associated. | no |
| `appliesIf` | function(contact, report, scheduledTaskIndex). The task can only be created for items where this function returns true. `scheduledTaskIndex` will be null for contacts and reports. | no |
| `resolvedIf` | function(contact, report, event, dueDate, index). Resolve the task only if this function returns true. | yes |
| `events` | An array of task events. The event's properties are used to specify the timeline of when a task will appear and disappear from the user interface. | yes |
| `events[n].id` | Unique ID for this task event. Helps when this is a descriptive id, eg `pregnancy-high-risk` | yes |
| `events[n].days` | Number of days after the doc's `reported_date` that the event is due | yes, if `dueDate` is not set |
| `events[n].start` | Number of days to show the task before it is due | yes |
| `events[n].end` | Number of days to show the task after it is due | yes |
| `events[n].dueDate` | function(report, event, scheduledTaskIdx). A date object of the day when the task event is due. If set this will override the `days` value. | yes, if `days` is not set |
| `actions` | This is an array of the actions (forms) that a user can access after clicking on a task. If you put multiple forms here, then the user will see a task summary screen where they can select which action they would like to complete. Within your array of `actions` there are some additional properties that you can define. | yes |
| `actions[n].type` | Type of action, usually `'report'`. | yes |
| `actions[n].form` | The form that should open when you click on the action. | yes |
| `actions[n].label`|  The label that should appear on the button to start this action on the task summary page ('Click here to begin the follow up' in our example summary screen above). | no |
| `actions[n].content`|  Contains fields that you want to pass into the form that will open when you click on the task or action. | no |
| `priority` | Object with the priority `level` and `label`. Can alternatively be a function that, given the contact and report an object with the priority `level` and `label`. | no |
| `priority.level` | Can be `high`, `medium` (default). Tasks that are high risk will display a high risk icon with the task. | no |
| `priority.label` | Text shown with the task associated to the risk level. | no |

## Additional code
Helper variables and functions can be defined in `nools-extras.js` to keep the task definitions easy to read and manage. To enable reuse of common code, `nools-extras.js` file is shared by both the Tasks and Targets.

### Tips & Tricks
1. There are some use cases where information collected during an action within a task schedule may mean that the task schedule must change. For example, if you register a child for malnutrition follow-ups, you collect the height and weight during registration and tasks for follow-ups are created based on the registration. At the next visit (first follow-up), you collect the height and weight again and you want to update these so that future tasks reference this new height and weight. You can either clear and regenerate the schedule after each follow-up visit is done, or you can create only one follow-up at a time so that height and weight are always referencing the most recent visit.
1. If you have a single action for a task, clicking the task will bring you straight to the specified form.
![Task form](img/task_form.png)
1. If you have more than one action, clicking a prompted task will show a summary screen with fields you have passed along with a button for each possible action.
![Task summary screen](img/task_summary_screen.png)


### Troubleshooting
1. Cannot see tasks: Makes sure in the Admin Console that the user is an offline user that is "restricted to their place".
1. Tasks is not clearing: Make sure the the code that generates the task is immutable, and that the resolved condition is correct.


# Targets
Health workers can easily view their goals and progress for the month, even while offline. Targets refers to the in-app analytics widgets. These widgets can be set to track metrics for an individual CHW or for an entire health facility, depending on what data the logged in user has access to. Targets can be seen by users that have offline access (user type is "restricted to their place"). When defining targets, you have access to all the contacts (people and places) that the logged in user would view, along with all the reports about them.

Like Tasks, a rules engine is used to generate the targets using the data available in the client app. The data, comprised of docs for people, places, and the reports about them, are processed by rules engine code to emit data for widgets like these:

<!-- TODO: Update annotated screenshots -->

#### Plain count with no goal

![Count no goal](img/target_count_no_goal.png)

#### Count with a goal

![Count with goal](img/target_count_with_goal.png)

#### Percentage with no goal

![Percentage no goal](img/target_percent_no_goal.png)

#### Percentage with a goal

![Percentage with goal](img/target_percent_with_goal.png)

The target instances emitted by the rules engine code are handled by the app. The app takes care of showing the target instances in the appropriate widgets of the Targets tab, updating counts and percentages automatically. Previously the application code for Targets would iterate through an object with all contacts accompanied by their reports. When the code identified a condition related to a target widget in `targets.json`, it created data for the widget as a _target instance_. 

With the new declarative style all targets are now defined in the `targets.js` file. In this file we define a JavaScript variable `targets` as an array of objects. Each object corresponds to a target widget that could show in the app. The properties for the object are used to define when the target widget can show, what it should look like, and what to values to include. 

Like `tasks.js`, the Targets file contains JavaScript but its modular and declarative nature makes it much easier to manage. For instance, here is a simple example that generates two `postnatal-visit` tasks for each `delivery` form:

```js
var targets = [
  // BIRTHS THIS MONTH
  {
    id: 'births-this-month',
    type: 'count',
    icon: 'infant',
    goal: -1,
    translation_key: 'targets.births.title',
    appliesTo: 'reports',
    appliesIf: isHealthyDelivery,
  },
```

## Target properties

More complex targets can be written using the full set of properties for targets, as detailed in the following table: 

| property | description | required |
|---|---|---|
| `id` |Unique identifier for the target | yes |
| `type` |The type of widget to show, either `count` or `percent`. | yes |
| `icon` |Icon to show with the target, matching the name in the resources file. | no, but recommended |
| `goal` |For percentage targets, you must put a positive number. For `count` targets, put a positive number if there is a goal. If there is no goal, put -1. | yes |
| `context` |The context in which this widget is relevant to the `user`. This widget will only be shown if the expression evaluates to true. | no |
| `translation_key` |Translation key for the title of this target. | no, but recommended |
| `subtitle_translation_key` |Translation key for the subtitle of this target. If none supplied the subtitle will be blank. | no |
| `percentage_count_translation_key` |Translation key for the percentage value detail shown at the bottom of the target, eg |"(5 of 6 deliveries)". The translation context has `pass` and `total` variables available. If none supplied this defaults to `targets.count.default`. | no |
| `appliesTo` | `'contacts'` or `'reports'`. The items which apply for this target widget. | yes |
| `appliesToType` | Array of report or contact types. The types of contacts (eg `['person']`, `['clinic', 'health_center']`) or form codes (eg `['pregnancy']`, `['P', 'pregnancy']`) for which this target is relevant. | no |
| `appliesIf` | function(contact, report, scheduledTaskIndex). The target is relevant only for items where this function returns true. `scheduledTaskIndex` will be null for contacts and reports. | no |
| `date` | By default only values for this month are shown in targets. Set to `'now'` if doing an all time count. Set to `'reported'` for time relevant counts, which relies on the doc's `reported_date`. | no |
| `emitCustom` | function(contact, report). Each defined target emits one target instance per doc. A function can be defined here to emit a custom target instance, or multiple instances. | no |
| `idType` | By default only one target instance is counted per contact. When multiple reports should be counted, eg counting multiple visits for a person, this property must be set to `'report'`. | no |
| `passesIf` | function(contact, report). Evaluated to determine if instance counts towards the value. For percent widgets this affects whether the instance is included in the numerator. | yes, if `type` is `'percent'` |

## Additional code
Helper variables and functions can be defined in `nools-extras.js` to keep the target definitions easy to read and manage. To enable reuse of common code, `nools-extras.js` file is shared by both the Tasks and Targets.

## Examples

### targets.js
```js
var targets = [
  // BIRTHS THIS MONTH
  {
    id: 'births-this-month',
    type: 'count',
    icon: 'infant',
    goal: -1,
    translation_key: 'targets.births.title',
    subtitle_translation_key: 'targets.this_month.subtitle',

    appliesTo: 'reports',
    appliesIf: isHealthyDelivery,
    date: 'reported',
  },

  // % DELIVERIES ALL TIME WITH 1+ VISITS
  {
    id: 'delivery-with-min-1-visit',
    type: 'percent',
    icon: 'nurse',
    goal: 100,
    translation_key: 'targets.delivery_1_visit.title',
    subtitle_translation_key: 'targets.all_time.subtitle',

    appliesTo: 'reports',
    idType: 'report',
    appliesIf: isHealthyDelivery,
    passesIf: function(c, r) {
      var visits = countReportsSubmittedInWindow(c.reports, antenatalForms, r.reported_date - MAX_DAYS_IN_PREGNANCY*MS_IN_DAY, r.reported_date);
      return visits > 0;
    },
    date: 'now',
  },
]
```

### nools-extras.js
```js
function isHealthyDelivery(c, r) {
  return r.form === 'D' ||
      (r.form === 'delivery' && r.fields.pregnancy_outcome === 'healthy');
}

function countReportsSubmittedInWindow(reports, form, start, end) {
  var reportsFound = 0;
  reports.forEach(function(r) {
    if (form.indexOf(r.form) >= 0) {
      if (r.reported_date >= start && r.reported_date <= end) {
        reportsFound++;
      }
    }
  });
  return reportsFound;
}

```

# Contacts
In the `app_settings.contact_summary` you can write a script to output fields for the contact info pane and help decide which reports should be able to be filed against a contact. The script is evaluated as JavaScript so all the standard language features are available. To make this easier to write and maintain, a declarative format is also available. In the `contact_summary.templated.js` file you specify three variables: `context`, `fields`, and `cards`.

<!-- TODO: Add annotated screenshot of a contact page showing structure -->

## Context
This object provides context information to Actions (aka "app forms") on the contact's profile page. The app form's `expression` can use the context to determine whether or not to show the form in the "New action" menu. When opening the action from the contact profile the context data is also available within the XForm.

## Fields
An array of fields are defined to show a summary of the contact at the top of their profile page.

![Summary card](img/summary-card.png)
<!-- TODO: Add updated annotated screenshot of summary card -->

Each field that can be shown on a contact's profile is defined as an objects in the `fields` array. The properties for each object determine how and when the field is shown.

| property | description | required |
|---|---|---|
| `appliesToType` | The type of contact with which this field should show. Set to `'person'` for person profile, or `'!person'` a place. | no | 
| `label` | Label shown with the field. Can be a translation key.  | yes |
| `value` | `function(r)`. The value shown for the field. Can be a property of the contact, eg `contact.date_of_birth`. | yes |
| `width` | The horizontal space for the field. Common values are 12 for full width, 6 for half width, or 3 for quarter width.| |
| `appliesIf` | A function that determines when the field should be shown. | no |
| `translate` | Whether or not to translate the value. Defaults to false. <!-- TODO: VERIFY IMPLEMENTED --> | no |
| `context` |  The fields available in the value's translation. eg {} | no | 
| `icon` | The name of the icon to display beside this field, as defined through the Configuration > Icons page. | no |
| `filter` | The display filter to apply to the value, eg: `{ value: '2005-10-09', filter: 'age' }` will render as "11 years". Common filters are: `age`, `phone`, `weeksPregnant`, `relativeDate`, `relativeDay`, `fullDate`, `simpleDate`, `simpleDateTime`, `lineage`, `resourceIcon`. For the complete list of filters, and more details on what each does, check out the code in [`medic-webapp/static/js/filters` dir](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/tree/master/static/js/filters). | no |

## Cards
An array of cards to show below the summary on the profile page. Each card has its own header and arrays of fields.

![Pregnancy card](img/pregnancy-card.png)
<!-- TODO: Add updated annotated screenshot of a profile card -->

| property | description | required |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | Label on top of card | yes |
| `appliesToType` | Type of contact where the card could show | no |
| `appliesIf` | Function that determines if the card should show | no |
| `fields` | Object for each field to show in the card | yes |
| `fields.label` | Label shown with the field. Can be a translation key.  | yes |
| `fields.value` | `function(r)`. The value shown for the field. Can be a property of the contact, eg `contact.date_of_birth`. | yes |
| `fields.width` | The horizontal space for the field. Common values are 12 for full width, 6 for half width, or 3 for quarter width.| |
| `fields.appliesIf` | A function that determines when the field should be shown. | no |
| `fields.translate` | Whether or not to translate the value. Defaults to false. <!--TODO: VERIFY IMPLEMENTED--> | no |
| `fields.context` |  The fields available in the value's translation. eg {} | no | 
| `fields.icon` | The name of the icon to display beside this field, as defined through the Configuration > Icons page. | no |
| `modifyContext` | function(ctx) | Used to modify or add values of the `context` | no |

# Notes

## Nools Extras
Helper variables and functions can be defined in `nools-extras.js`, which is shared by both `tasks.js` and `targets.js`. The following are global variables that can be used:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `c.contact` | The contact's doc. All contacts have `type` of either `person` or `place`.
| `c.reports` | An array of all the reports submitted about the contact.
| `console` | Useful for outputting _debugging_ statements. Should not be used in production code. |
| `Utils` | Useful functions across projects are available, and describe in the Utils section. |

## Contact Summary Extras
Helpfer variables and functions for the contact summary can be defined in `contact-summary-extras.js`. There are several variables available to inspect to generate the summary information:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `contact` | The currently selected contact. This has minimal stubs for the `contact.parent`, so if you want to refer to a property on the parent use `lineage` below.| 
| `reports` | An array of reports for the contact. | 
| `lineage` | An array of the contact's parents (2.13+), eg `lineage[0]` is the parent, `lineage[1]` is the grandparent, etc. Each lineage entry has full information for the contact, so you can use `lineage[1].contact.phone`. | 

## Utils
Utility functions are available for your configuration and have been included to make common tasks much easier. To use the function call `Utils.<function-name>(<params>)`, for example `Utils.addDate(report.reported_date, 10)`.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| isTimely(date, event) | Returns true if the given date is after the start date and before the end date of the event. |
| addDate(date, days) | Returns a new Date set to midnight the given number of days after the given date. If no date is given the date defaults to today. |
| getLmpDate(doc) | Attempts to work out the LMP from the given doc. If no LMP is given it defaults to four weeks before the reported_date. |
| getSchedule(name) | Returns the task schedule with the given name from the configuration. |
| getMostRecentTimestamp(reports, form) | Returns the reported_date of the most recent of the reports with form ID matching the given form. |
| getMostRecentReport(reports, form) | Like `getMostRecentTimestamp` but returns the report, not just the reported_date. |
| isFormSubmittedInWindow(reports, form, start, end) | Returns true if any of the given reports are for the given form and were reported after start and before end. |
| isFirstReportNewer(firstReport, secondReport) | Returns true if the firstReport was reported before the secondReport. |
| isDateValid(date) | Returns true if the given date is a validate JavaScript Date. |
| now() | Returns the current Date. |
| MS_IN_DAY | A constant for the number of milliseconds in a day. |
