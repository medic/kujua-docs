# Connecting to RDBMS in Windows 
Connecting to the postgres server is pretty stratightforward in nix systems. In windows there are a couple of things you need to do to get it up and running. 

## SSH Key Generation and Importing

1. Download Puttygen from [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/download)

2. Run Puttygen Go to Windows Start menu → All Programs → PuTTY→ PuTTYgen.

3. Create a new key pair for your computer.

4. Convert the key generated from ssh2 format to openssh. Puttygen supports this. Guide [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2224066/how-to-convert-ssh-keypairs-generated-using-puttygenwindows-into-key-pairs-use?answertab=votes#tab-top)

```
1. Open PuttyGen
2. Click Load
3. Load your private key
4. Go to Conversions->Export OpenSSH and export your private key
5. Copy your private key to ~/.ssh/id_dsa (or id_rsa).
6. Create the RFC 4716 version of the public key using ssh-keygen
    ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa > ~/.ssh/id_dsa_com.pub
6. Convert the RFC 4716 version of the public key to the OpenSSH format:
    ssh-keygen -i -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa_com.pub > ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
    
```


5. Import the file using PuTTYgen:

6. Save it as PuTTY Private Key File .ppk:

![puttty-save-key](img/putty/putty-save-key.png)

7. Add the key (.ppk) to Pageant (PuTTY authentication agent):

8. Now you can connect to RDBMS using PuTTY:

If you are connecting to rdbms in order to use a posgres client. You may not need to tunnel the connection. The client can do it for you.
