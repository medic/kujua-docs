# Internal product team communication

## Daily

Each day engineers post our objectives in the #dailies Slack channel for the previous and current day and discuss any potential blockers. If an issue will not be completed within an iteration time frame that should be discussed.

There are optional daily standup meetings twice a day roughly 12 hours apart. Show up to whichever one fits with your timezone. It's a good place to check in and discuss issues.

## Weekly

Each week the team meets on a call to discuss progress and plans for the next week. Notes are taken in the [agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14AuJ7SerLuOPESBjQlJqpBtzwSAoVf5ykTT7fjyJBT0/edit#). Someone reports back so our progress can be reported in #medic-news for the wider team.

## Monthly

At the end of each month we review progress and plan the goals for the next month.
