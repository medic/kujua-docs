New to Git or need a refesher?

 - [A tutorial introduction to Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
 - [A tutorial introduction to Git: part two](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial-2)
 - [A Git core tutorial for developers](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcore-tutorial)

If you're on Unix, these are also likely installed as man pages:

```
man gittutorial
man gittutorial-2
man gitcore-tutorial
```

For more reading, [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book) is available online, and
[Chapter 10: Git Internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)
is quite helpful.

Published a commit by mistake?  GitHub has a decent writeup on that:

Pulling a module out of an existing repository and want to preserve the git
history?  The `git-filter-branch` manual has some tips:
